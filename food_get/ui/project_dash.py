To find the percent of a census tract that has access to a grocery store within a half mile, first, the process creates Â½ mile buffers around grocery stores in Chicago. These buffer boundaries are then overlaid with census tract boundaries to find the area that is not covered by the grocery store buffers (i.e., difference area). To find the ratio, or percent, of a tract that is serviced by a grocery store within a half-mile radius, we take one minus the difference area over the tract area. Once each tract has an associated ratio, we classify them as low-access if the ratio is less than 33%. For the low-income metric, we compare each tractâ€™s median household income to the county-wide (Cook County) median household income. If the tractâ€™s median household income is less than or equal to 80 percent of the county's median household income, then the tract is labeled as low-income.",
